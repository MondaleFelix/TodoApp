### Description
___

A native iOS implmentation of a todo list app. Users are able to create, read, update and delete todos to manage their day to day responsibilites. This app is built with SwiftUI and architectured with MVVM. 

### Work Flow
___

To create a project that is maintainable and accessible to contribute, I studied on the SOLID principles and made the design decision to use MVVM to structure the app. First few days of the project entailed researching and studying MVVM and SwiftUI. The second half of the week was implementing and building out the necessary components. While creating this project, I emphasized the SOLID principles as well as DRY.
